# Desktop-DeepZoom-Image-converter
This is a standalone, packaged windows install for a program that converts .tif and .jpeg to .dzi.

This program does not require python to be installed nor does it require you to deprecate your PIL install.

### Key features
- this program will allow you to select multiple input files for a batch conversion.
- The outputs are then usuable for Petro-Image (https://github.com/grsharman/petro-image). 
- this program does *not* require Admin access to install. 
- the version as of 12/23/2025 also exports a log file for easy error handling. If you receive an error, send this log file to Ethan to aid in the debuging. Note that it will export a log file for each conversion...sorry that's a lot of log files. 



To install, download "dzi-converter-install" and follow the instructions. If you work at a univeristy or institution that does not allow programs to be installed without administrator access, this install is designed to bypass it ... or so I am told (shhh). 

When you install the program, it will show up with this icon:
