# Desktop-DeepZoom-Image-converter
This is a standalone, packaged windows install for a program that converts .tif and .jpeg to .dzi.

This program does not require python to be installed nor does it require you to deprecate your PIL install.

To install, download "mysetup.exe" and follow the instructions. If you work at a univeristy or institution that does not allow programs to be installed without administrator access, this install is designed to bypass it.
