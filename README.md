# Desktop-DeepZoom-Image-converter
This is a standalone, packaged windows install for a program that converts .tif and .jpeg to .dzi.

This program does not require python to be installed nor does it require you to deprecate your PIL install.

### Key features
- this program will allow you to select multiple input files for a batch conversion.
- The outputs are then usuable for Petro-Image (https://github.com/grsharman/petro-image). 
- this program does *not* require Admin access to install. 
- the version as of 12/23/2025 also exports a log file for easy error handling. If you receive an error, send this log file to Ethan to aid in the debuging. Note that it will export a log file for each conversion...sorry that's a lot of log files. 
- The progress bar captures how many images arr already processed. The bar is scaled by the number of input files. If you only input one file, it will not fill until the file is totally done (at the end). 

*Note: for large files, such as a large tif, this program will take up to several minutes to convert. Have no fear, the conveter will explictly tell you that it has failed, otherwise it is processing.* 




To install, download "Deep-zoom-image-converter_v2.exe" and follow the instructions. If you work at a univeristy or institution that does not allow programs to be installed without administrator access, this install is designed to bypass it ... or so I am told (shhh). 

When you install the program, it will show up with this icon:
